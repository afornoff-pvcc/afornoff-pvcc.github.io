Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side. Thus, two machines residing on the same side of a bridge can exchange messages without interfering with communication taking place on the other side. A bridge produces a more efficient system than that produced by a repeater.</td>

Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel. As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination addresses of all messages and forwards only those messages destined for other spokes. Moreover, each message that is forwarded is relayed only into the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke.</td>
