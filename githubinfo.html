<h1>All About GitHub</h1>

<h2>Q & A</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Q. What is a version control system?</h3>
<li>A. A category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.</li>
<h3>Q. What is Git?</h3>

<li>A. GitHub was founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P.J. Hyatt, and Scott Chacon. It was started because they were frustrated with how difficult it was back in 2008 to add changes to the source code for projects they worked on for CNET through Ruby on Rails.</li>

<h2>Git/GitHub Terms</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Repository</h3>
<li>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. in your project, building a history over time.</li>
<h3>Commit</h3>
<li>An individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</li>

<h3>Fork</h3>
<li>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.</li>

<h3>Push</h3>
<li>To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</li>

<h3>Pull requests</h3>
<li>Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.</li>

<h3>Workflows</h3>
<li>A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</li>

<h3>Issues</h3>
<li>Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion thread. You can also categorize an issue with labels and assign it to someone.</li>

<h3>Raw button</h3>
<li>The raw button opens the file in a raw form, meaning that any HTML formatting disappears.</li>

<h3>Blame button</h3>
<li>The "blame" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.</li>
